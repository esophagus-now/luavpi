[ ] Add prompt string argument to repl() call in Lua
[ ] Steal nicer repl features from standalone lua interpreter
[ ] Figure out how to get current sim time
[ ] Add value change and RO sync callbacks
[ ] Do a better job of dealing with vpi_put_value
    - It might be enough to just add support for string formats
    - Should also supply a release function to drop forces
[ ] Save states? Technically it is possible to save all
    registers and forced values so that we can reset them
    later
    -> This could be written in lua instead of in C++, but
       of course performance would suffer
    -> Oh my god! Apparently there are $save and $restart
       system functions defined by the verilog standard to
       do exactly this!
[ ] Timonerie support (https://github.com/esophagus-now/timonerie)
    -> This shouldn't be too difficult
[ ] Keep wrapping more VPI functions
    - vpi_handle_by_index, vpi_handle_by_multi_index
    - vpi_get_vlog_info
    - vpi_get_systf_info
    - etc.
