[ ] Add prompt string argument to repl() call in Lua
[ ] Steal nicer repl features from standalone lua interpreter
[x] Figure out how to get current sim time
[/] Add value change and RO sync callbacks
[/] Add some way for user to know which cb was triggered
    - I have a proof-of-concept working that shows I can return
      values from vpi.wait() or yield()
      - Probably I should put that s_cb_data that VPI gives to
        to your cb function into a lua table and return that
      - The alternative is that the user should supply a tag
        for every callback and we would return that
[ ] Let lua code add a "user data" field to the cb data table that
    it passes to vpi.register_cb(). We'll be forced to save this
    value into the registry then put the registry index into the
    the real s_cb_data struct we make in C (then fish the user's
    lua value back out at the other end)
[ ] Do a better job of dealing with vpi_put_value
    - It might be enough to just add support for string formats
    - Should also supply a release function to drop forces
[ ] Save states? Technically it is possible to save all
    registers and forced values so that we can reset them
    later
    -> This could be written in lua instead of in C++, but
       of course performance would suffer
    -> Oh my god! Apparently there are $save and $restart
       system functions defined by the verilog standard to
       do exactly this!
[ ] Timonerie support (https://github.com/esophagus-now/timonerie)
    -> This shouldn't be too difficult... the big headache is dealing
       with either a dependency on luasocket, luaposix, or trying to
       to get this code compiling with winsock (yuck)
[ ] Keep wrapping more VPI functions
    - vpi_handle_by_index, vpi_handle_by_multi_index
    - vpi_get_vlog_info
    - vpi_get_systf_info
    - vpi_control
    - etc.
[ ] Add documentation for compiling in all the well-known simulators
    - Icarus Verilog (yeah, people can try to to read my build scripts... 
      but nice docs would be better)
    - Verilator (annoyingly, you have to mark things `verilator public` 
      if you want to access them in VPI... yuck!)
    - VCS
    - Modelsim
    - There are other verilog simulators out there, but I don't have 
      access to them
[ ] Add system task where verilog can just run a snippet of lua code
    (instead of always dropping to a repl)
[ ] FIXME: if a coroutine hooks up a value-change callback but throws
    an error and dies, the simulation will keep calling it anyway and
    we get a bunch of "cannot resume dead coroutine" messages
[ ] Automatically keep track of outstanding callbacks. Too often I've
    lost the handle to a callback but wish I could delete it. It would
    also be nice to just see a nice list of active callbacks
    - One good way would be for the C code to register more than the
      thread itself in the registry. Right now we I think we do 
      registry[th] = th just to prevent the thread from being gc'ed.
      We could instead make the value a table with all the metadata
      we would like to keep around for this thread, and if we're really
      good about it, we could do it in such a way that we could let the
      lua code see its own metadata
      - I think you can use metatables to make a table read-only, 
        something like:
        my_real_table = {some_data = 7}
        give_this_to_user = {}
        rotab = {
            __metatable = "none of your beeswax", 
            __index= my_real_table, 
            __newindex= function() error("nope!") end
        }
        setmetatable(give_this_to_user, rotab)
